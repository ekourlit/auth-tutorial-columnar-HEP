Physicists analyze PHYSLITE data to study the properties of the particles produced in each event.\n",

    "- **Reduced File Size:** PHYSLITE targets a file size of 10 kB per event for data and 12 kB for MC, a significant reduction compared to previous formats.\n",
    "- **CPU Efficiency:** Preliminary evaluations show a 25% reduction in CPU usage compared to previous models.\n",
    "- **Unskimmed and Monolithic:** PHYSLITE is designed to be a one-size-fits-all solution, fitting various use cases without the need for multiple versions.\n",
    "- **Direct Analysis Capability:** PHYSLITE can be analyzed directly, avoiding the need for creating flat n-tuples and further reducing storage demands.\n",

    "PHYSLITE data are highly structured and can be represented in a tabular format. However, since each event can contain variable number of particles, this will be a _ragged_ or _jagged_ table. \n",
