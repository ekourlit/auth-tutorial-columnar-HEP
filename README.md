# HEP Data Analysis Tutorial with the Scientific Python Ecosystem

Welcome to the repository for the HEP (High Energy Physics) Data Analysis Tutorial, held on Wednesday, June 4th, 2025, within the module of Advanced Studies in Experimental Data Analysis Methods as part of the Graduate Studies in SubAtomic Physics and Technological Applications in the Physics Department at Aristotle University of Thessaloniki.

This repository provides all the resources you need to follow the tutorial.

### Tutorial Structure

The tutorial is divided into five parts, each focusing on a key topic:

1. [part-1](part-1): Introduction to Array-oriented programming
2. [part-2](part-2): Array-oriented programming with Jagged Data
3. [part-3](part-3): Introduction to HEP Data
4. [part-4](part-4): Accessing and Analyzing PHYSLITE Data
5. [part-5](part-5): Statistical Analysis

### How to Use the Tutorial Materials

In each directory, there are two Jupyter notebooks:

  * **lecture-slides:** the presentation
  * **lecture-workbook:** for participants to use during the lecture; acts as a scratch-pad for trying code and solving "quizlets"

In [part-2](part-2) and [part-4](part-4), there are two additional notebooks:
  * **project:** a larger exercise to work on as homework
  * **solutions:** solutions of the project

In [part-5](part-5) there are additional auxiliary files needed or generated by the notebook.

During the live tutorial, participants should open the **lecture-workbook**. The **lecture-slides** will be projected on a big screen by the lecturer. Offline, after the event, open both notebooks and read through the **lecture-slides**.

## Data access
The data used in this tutorial are part of the 2024 Open Data for Research release from the ATLAS experiment at CERN. The data can and can be found at DOI:[10.7483/OPENDATA.ATLAS.9HK7.P5SI](http://doi.org/10.7483/OPENDATA.ATLAS.9HK7.P5SI).

For more details about the release and available datasets, visit the [ATLAS Open Data portal](https://opendata.atlas.cern/).

## Getting started

### Run on your personal computer

If you have some version of conda/mamba/Anaconda/Miniconda/Miniforge, you can create and activate a Python environment, install the [`requirements.lock`](requirements.lock), built from the high level [`requirements.txt`](requirements.txt),  and run the notebooks in e.g. JupyterLab.

```console
conda env create --name auth-tutorial-columnar-hep --yes python=3.9   # can replace "conda" with "mamba"
conda activate auth-tutorial-columnar-hep
python -m pip install --upgrade --no-deps --require-hashes --requirement requirements.lock
```

### Run on Binder

Alternatively, you can click the button below to run the notebooks online via Binder:
